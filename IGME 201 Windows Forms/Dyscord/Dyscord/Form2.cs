//for exam 3 question 1 we analyze the applicaiton and list all of the controls in applicaiton and in pesudeocode what constructor
//needs and what event handlers we need and what method are needed and what the pesudocode should be for all of our methods

//for houdini picture box we triggered if the mouse entered or leave the image 
//for the 0 windows tutorial and the events have the lightning icons next to them when we hover over 
//all of our controls in windows app are seperate threads that are running but are very lmiited because we can only act on them based on the lmiited
//set of events we can trigger
//the button can also trigger when we hover over it to exit and it changes color
//but we cant have the picturebox do something based on another field and we can only have picturebox events which are very lmiited
//most flexible windows forms control is the timer control that llows us to do mainly anything
//we could have timer run every millisecond and every millisecond we could have timer control do seomthing but its still lmimited because
//it jumps into our code fresh each time and we need variables to store where our time was at when we restart program
//if we want to write a program that has total control over itself and does not need an external trigger to be initiated is with the thread class
