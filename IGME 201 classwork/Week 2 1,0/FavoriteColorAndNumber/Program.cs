            // use a for(initialization;condition;operation) loop to output their favorite color the number of times as their favorite number
            // The three statements within the for() statement:
            //      1. initialization statement(s):  (i = 0) any variable initialization
            //          Note that this can include multiple comma-separated statements.
            //              For example:   for( i=0, y=0, color=Console.ReadLine(); i < favNum; ++i)
            //
            //      2. condition check:  (i < favNum) what to check at the beginning of the loop each time it loops (including the first time)
                    //usually use boolean operators wtih multiple variables like and and or the or 
            //
            //      3. operation: (++i)  any operations to execute upon each subsequent start of the loop (not including the first time)
            //          Note that this can include multiple comma-separated statements.
            //              For example:   for( i=0, y=0, color=Console.ReadLine(); i < favNum; ++i, ++y)
            //
            //          Note that using the "continue" statement to return to the top of the loop will execute the operation statement(s)
            //          so that if you need to do something N times, you may have to --i before the "continue" to repeat the same value of i. 
                        //for loop talking about temp. if its cold, we want to stop and wait until its hotter and when we go back to the top
                        //of the loop, and incremeent basically a retry to see if we can skip the contintue statement, after if we skip the
                        //continue then we can incremeent and keep going about the code but if we do the continue we need a rettry so we decrement
                        //then increment againn



                        //& = bitwise and operator
                        //| = bitwise or operator

                        //and the single ones check both the values before 
                        //on the operations it evaluates from left to right and not highest to lowest based from left to right 
                        //unary is the sign of the number being pos. or neg.

                //Console.WriteLine("5 + 5 = " + x.ToString() + x.ToString());

                // use parentheses to change order of operation to get correct result

//Definitions**
//continue ends the current loop and goes back up to the condition for the new loop
//return exits the whole loop and method
//break exits the loop only, not the method 
//goto allows us to jump out of our loop if we wanted (or not) and go to
//a specific area outside of our loop (or within our loop)
