    //strings have a method called split and it returns a string that was split by a certain character or seperator (not included anymore)**
    //with arrays we can use a for loop (condtion would be less than the length of the array and to access the value
    ////it would be vairble[index]) or a for each loop, but the for each is only used for arrays**
    //for each goes through the array of strings and each string its on would be equal to the first varibale we made in the foresch**
    //cant modify the iterator (the thing that is set equal to each element in the string as we move on in our array)**
    //new command creates the array variables**
    //if we want to modify a value use the ref. keyword so the variable gets changed but still do it even though array are call by refernece**
