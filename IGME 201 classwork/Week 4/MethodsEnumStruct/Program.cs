///its whatever the variable was before it tried to parse it if the parse does not work

//everything we can do in a structure, we can do in a class
//structures are kind of like object oriented but are not object oriented (does not support OOP)(like inheritence etc.)
//(classes are object oriented and encapsulate functionality
//into one space for objects)(and structtures are objects but they are
//value types) because we can include methods within the structrues like encrypt and decrypt

//classes allow us to reuse different types of code/methods and structs can too but its by value
//classes inherit from each other  (super to inherit from the parent within the child)
//if we have class called shape, circles,triangles,andsqiares, can access the shape class from super
//and we can share the methods like a method from the shape class into the circles,triangles,etc. to be used 
//general class for all shared prop. and the child class we would have to call a specific formula based on the methods in the parent class
//and it will use the correct method based on the class we are accessing 
//we can basically write the same code to write the area of any shape because the code will know autoatmically which method to call because it knows
//what the child class is (will call the appropriate child method if we have it in the child otherwise it calls the parent)
//since the formula is different for each class, in the shape class the parent shape class has a method to calculate the area and each of the child classes
//will tell us how to calculate it but the main shape class we have access to that method 
//the child class with the circle will inherit an area method and we can calculate the area for that specific shape and in the parent we can have a default area 
//put in that method and in the child we can ovwer ride it within the child and make a new one for the child or we can make it empty in the parent and make it
//an abstract method whihc means its just a placeholder (empty method) and the child needs to provide the actual formula
//if the child does not implement its own version of the method then it will use the parents version
