//why cant we have protected for interface because isnt it techinically referencing things within the child and parent classes so dont they inherit from the interface 
//(the interface is outside of the class and is different and the class is inheriting the interface)
//same for the DrawMe because it was an abstact and it still means its overridden and it's only going to be used throughougt the classes only****(can classes be protected(no))****
//does protected not allow instances (we are still allowed to create instances of classes when its protected and the protected fields can only be accessed from the class with this.
//not the instance .)(we can access it internally but not externally)
//constrcutor is named r and is named double and it calls the base constructor
//and passes r and 0 into the base constructor** so do we over ride the constructor basically when
//we do this for child classes with their own values? (we create its own constructor)
//when we do new it creates a new object and when we did new circle and we passed in raidus we passed r to the circle class and that created an object for us 
//and then when we created the circle object it puts all the members in the instance and now the when we use circle consuructor it gets passed to the parent
//because we used base and r for x and 0 for y and then after that and the constructor allows us to set the members of new object we created when it ref. child class
//when it gets created)
//we can use base to access methods from the parent (our shape method has an area method and our circle over rides it with its own area and if we want to call
//the base version still in the child (circle) we would do base.Area() and it would call the version in the parent and not the childs over ridden version of it)
//we can have an if statament if circle was a rectangle then we could do the base.Area()
//we would seal a class for secuuity features so we cant inherit or in some way hack the secuirty features (if we inherit we can impersnate the parent class)
//in this case if we had static things within a class (is it common?(no)) we would use the class name then . notation to access the method or variable or whatever
//is sttaic (static members apply to everything in the class/struct including its children and parent)(same as structures to access)
//do we have to create a constructor within the child always(we have to ref. the base constructor for the child classes like we did with each child class to make
//an instance)(first we create the values for the children then input them into the parent with base(kind of like the para. from the child being put into the parent
//as an argument when we create the child values like double r in circle for example))
//(we need a child constructor always)(we can also make our own unique child constructor by having rectangle do public Recntagnle(double w, double h) {
// this.x = w then this.y = h} or just use the base thing we did in which is more efficient whereas the thing we just did duplicates the code from the parent
//constructos (so basically making a seperate child constructor does not use base and would be sep. from parent unless we use base keyword and with this.
//it has its own constructor and when we ref. area in the instance it goes to that child consturcror with this. then uses that then does area)
//and then to just use an inherited constructor just use base(yes) (so when we use base for the circle class then it ref. the parent constructor and when we use
//this.x this.x in the circle then it inherits that parent constructor and thats how we can access those values that are intiialized)
//for private it means its only within the class not the instance (outside of it)(only this.)
//we can still use this. within the child when it references parent because we are technically in a class, but we are referencing the parent class instead
////of something within the child
//can we create an instance of a class within a class of a differnt class or the same class type we are in (yes and we can define classes within other classes)
//constructors usually have the same name as the class 
//our constructure we write ourselves overrides the default constructor otherwise if we dont have our own constructure we use the default and use . notation
//but if we have our own constructor we have to make the default constureutre as well if we want to use it otheriwse we would get an error
//in consutrctors we can do anything in them as well as initialize fields 
//since static members dont count as instances that means we have to explicitly change the values within the children (if we make static within parent 
//then we can use the parentclass.static thing but if in child its only accessible within the child and only access with childclass.static)
///(we can have private static things but its only accessible within the class (codeblock)
//and it cant be shared within the class and the protected can only be seen with this. not instance)
//if we had Shapes myRect = new Rectangle(1,2) then to access rectangle stuff within it we would explicitly cast it
//bool isSquare = ((Rectangle)myRect).IsSquare exactly to access it
//would this myrect var be equal to a rectangle now instead of shape for the rest of the main block meaning it can also access reectnalge stuff since it was casted (yes)
//we need to explicitly cast when we are trying to set a less specific type equal to a more specific type 
//if shape was not abstract and wanted to set circle equal to shape we have to do that explicitly because it's more specific (we can say shape = circle variable though because
//its more generic and now we can take that shape lump of clay and make the circle out of it)(always can take a more generic class and implicitly cast it to a specific class)
//since its abstacrtct we can only create the variable then have it point to the child (set it to any of its children) (Shapes shape = new child())(in the case its abstract)
//interface is more generic and take a varible of it and if class inherits from it we can point to any object of it from the interface (like above statement) (alwyays the case)
//can use typeof() or something is inctance of something to see if its an instance of something and we can use it with other data types
//(usually used if(instance.GetType() == typeof(class)) (used for seeing if its the exact same thing so use same exact class like circle instance and circle class)**
//and the "is" is used for if they are similar like parent and child (if they are related**
//alyways put Gettype() when using typeof()
//we need to have an instance and we need to compare it with the data type always (like classes)
//put the instance in the first part then compare to a class

//if we use a shape class and define it to be a new shape like rectangle it only does the things that are common within parent and child like the methods and stuff
//but if we want stuff only within the child accessible then we would access the rectangle class specifcially and not just the parent setting equal to new rectangle 
//or explicitly cast the parent to the child Shapes myRect = new Rectangle(1,2) then bool isSquare = ((Rectangle)myRect)
/*
 * what data do I need to save about my shapes and how could I structure it to make it easier to get to 
 * we start by drawing yumul diagrams 
 * Have a parent class called shape and its a generic class that the children will inherit from (have as many shared prop,fields,methods and construcors in it)
 * our child classes get created from the parent class 
 * For interfaces put Inameofinterface before interface names as well (put I before interface names)(naming convention)
 *for interfaces can we use captial or lowercase i because in class we used I but in shumul it said i (have to put uppercase I (pascalecase)))
 *always have 4 boxes defining child and parent classes and we leave the boxes blank if we dont use it 
 *interfaces:
 *class can contain fields and stuff and we can create new instances and we cant create instances out of interfaces it and its just used as a handle so its a way to
 *pick up an object and use it and we can define an interface variable like the IdrawObject drawObject (just a varibale not an instance no new keyword)
 *interfaces are not a data type we can create and we can only declare variable of that type and we can basically have a student and teacher class inherit the Iperson
 *interface and we can use the interface when we create the instance of the teacher and student objects and now we can make a variable of the teacher and access
 *the name from the teacher class and have only some things that are similar (within those classes that we want to use) 
 *in the interface to access only specific values 
 *within the interface for the things we want to use like name and age instead of a class having a thousand things in it and its a way to give us a handle
 *to get certan things from larger classes but interfaces only take in properties and methods and we 
 *usually just reference things there and we dont make anything and we reference 
 *the drawme method for the interface above for the blood and other classes (so basically interfaces are pointers)(yes)
 *usually put the ";" right after the reference of the method means its a ref. (no code block it means we defined a method that does not do anything and it does not make sense)
 *(no implementation in interface)(interface defines the references)
 *classes have to have each property and each method that we use in the interface to use it (the interface) not only a couple (if its inherited everything in interface must be
 *in the class)
 *shumul diagrams:
 * first box is name of class(public means it can be accessed anywhere in our application across out application,(we would access with instance name. or this. within
 * and outside the code block for the class or where its defined for whatever is public)
 * (-symbol in front from shumul for private which means its only available within the code block)
 *when it says same assembly for internal thats only within the same dll files only and we would access it the same way like this. and the instance . outside the class
 *why would we want to use internal within a dll if its only accessible in the dll and the code never even runs in there because theres no main 
 *if we want methods only within the dll itself from within the dll so that we dont expose a bunch or stuff to the outside world that nobodody needs to see 
 *it basically hides stuff that's only used in the dll and not anywhere else outside of it (we want to make it as simple as possible)(only make things
 *public that we want people to see)
 *for private its only accessible within the class codeblock but we can access it with this. within the teacher class for example if the teacher class was private 
 *for structs it was only in the sturcture not within the namespace
 *when we make the class abstract its like a sealed class and we cant create an object out of it ex. the shape shape1 = new shape() becaue its too generic
 *but it can have things inherit out of it (can still make a Shapes instance but with the a new child class() declaration instead for abstract)
 * (we can make our class abstract and it can only be used to derive new classes and cant be used to create a generic shape instance with that fomula because its empty, and only child classes
 * can be made out of abstract classes)(after we over ride (do we over ride or just get created in child for abstract since its empty in parent(it counts as an over ride))(we have 
 * to explicitly say its an abstract method otheriwse it complains theres not a code block) 
 * (we can then access it via the instance with . notation once we over ride it in the child class with the 
 * child instance only or could we also do it with the parent definer then new child class() since it was inherited)(yes)
 * (we access methods from objects instances by circle.nameofmethod(para.))(do we need to set it to variable though so it does not get lost or)(we need to have a variable to 
 * store it in unless we want to just print it out to the screen)
 * but not abstract constuctor cause its tech.default
 * constructor)(abstract is only with classes,methods, and prop. but they have to be contained within abstract classes though and not alone)(can only have abstract
 * prop. and methods but we dont do abstract prop. and abstact can only be in abstact class)
 * fields in our class is the second box(any data type that is not a property that we have to declare in the class)(we usually declare in class the instance fields thhough only
 * //unless we make something sttaic for that class)
 * in this case we got 2 doubles and an int. (fields) for the A:shape class)(+ means accessible from outide the class(public))
 * (private is the - and only accessible within the shape class basically its 
 * within the code block that defines the shape for private)(the = means protected (the fields is accessible only within the class and the children and nowhere else for protected)
 * (in this case the x and y (the doubles) are only available within shape and any derived classes of shape llike the children but not available from
 * outside the family tree of our classes)
 *the third box are any methods or properties(they have a + sign so they are public, but they could also have a - sign for private and they can also be proectetd and internal
 *(internal is also used for fields) and its not really common, only private public and protected) we have some additional attributes after the
 *area method declarstion (:v means its a virtual method which means that we are trying to define a default method for calculating the area of the shape and any children that
 *inherit from shape, they can inherit this formula (area method) by default and we use the area of a rectangle by default in the parent class and then we can over ride it within out
 *child classes for the specific shape(put virtual when we want to over ride in child only)
 *in the cylinder the last box is saying that the name of the variable then the dataa type usually
 *method : its return type but if it took in something put it in the () of the method 
 *(draw me had a :a after it which means its an abstract method we put the :a after for methods and A: before for parent or child classes for abstract)(oppisite)
 *for the second box we do "method name(para.) : return type then accessibility"(for methods only) 
 *as well as for the second entry in it, we use the name of the method then () then : 
 *the return type of the method if there is one (put nothing if no return type and that means void) (do all methods need accessibility like virtual, and abstract,etc.)
 *default for methods is internal for methods and its restricted as possible (most restricted is private or internal for most things)
 *we should make it as explicit as possible and include all of theaccessiblity even though its public
 *:v for virtual(we always assume it must be an over ridden method for the children if we use :v)(yes), then :o for child overrding
 *draw me is an abstract method and it would be different for every child shape and abstract means it cant have any code block with it and no implementation code within the parent
 *and the child must implemement its own method for drawing it
 *we want to have a constrcutore that accesspts our 2 dimensions (x and y)(if we want to use default and our own default constructor, 
 *then we include that in the diagram otherwise we
 *dont include it in our diagram if we dont use the empty constructor)(yes) (if we have only the default do we still include it in shumul)(if we only use default we can leave
 *out the constructor for it if its only default) 
 *will return an error if we over ride our custom constructors (create custom constructor only once and not do it again with the same exact signautre)(yes)
 *if we create a custom constructor and we try to use a defualt constructor without it being defined then we get an error 
 *
 *shumul:
 *to derive we create more boxes and create a box for the circle class which has 4 parts (the second part is empty for all children because we are not making any new fields
 *for the child specifically and the parent would not see anything new or over ridden within the child class)(yes)
 *theres no private with classes in shumul so is it true in general(yes)
 *(we can combine public with abstract ssealed static or nothing or we could do internal with any of those 3 combined or nothing)
 *the third box will have two methods that will overridden (virtual or abstract to be over ridden and child must implement with a code block)
 *in child class and we need to overide the area method from our parent so we use 
 *:o to say we are overriding default method
 *(do we always have to have a :a (abstract blank method) or a :v (virtual = default method, methods only or) associated with a :o
 *(over ridiing a defult method in the child, only)(we can associate :o with both)
 *and the drawing method was absract in parent method so we also do :o when we implmement an abstract method
 *for our constructor for a circle we accept radius for our parameter and it calls parent constructor passing the x dimension as the radius and y as 0********
 *in order to call anything specifically in parent we use the "base" keyword (in JS it was super) base refers to the parent class and lets us access
 *the specific implememntation in the parent and not the overidden one within the child
 *in the parent class(if we want to call default area nethod from parent class we do base.area) or would it be parent instance = new childinstaance() then
 *after we can acccess it there with instances too if it was a parent instance or child (either or)
 *
 *
 *for rectangle its missing the area method because it was inherited from parent shape class so we dont add that into the rectagnle because we can just call the default from
 *parent and we also add a boolean which is a property to see if its a square or not to implement that parent method((read only) :r)
 *
 *we could use the property for the rectangle by returning true or false if it was x=y and when we create an instance, we could do if(reectangle.IsSquare){console.write
 *line("thisrectangle is a square))} basically it checks and we can do something based on that
 *
 *classes constructors structs methods properties data types (any data types) enum and delegates are pascale case
 * 
 *
 *shumul allows us to easily go from diagram to code
 *child classes always point to their parent when making shumul digrams (bottom to top) (always)
 *and the lines styles are specific to the kind of class that the parent is (if we are inheriting from a normal (public) parent class thats not abstract then its a solid line
 *to point frm child to parent, but if we inherit from an absratct class then we use dotted line)(in our diagram it was a dotted line to go from parent to child)if our
 *parent class was not abstract it would be a solid line**
 *
 *
 *
 *1-1 class relationships and 1-to-many on shumul
 *1-1 means 2 classes that are related to each other and it means there can be one instance of wife per husbane
 *we can also have 1-many and we can have customers class which contains customers and we can have one of those then
 *a customer class then have an list of customer in customers class and have one to many relatinoship 
 *the list of the customers is each customer from our customer class (customers has a bunch of customer class objects)

        //only the child, then we could only use it with the child instance(yes)

        //and eveyryhting on our phone inherits from keyboard interface)(only cares about allowing users to enter data and type into an app nothing else)
        //do properties usually take a return type in shumul(no)

        //any parent data type can be used to access any child datatype and we could pass in any of our drawObject because Idrawobject was iherited by the children

//and each child class had the different devices the song can be played on and it inherits the play method and how to play it based on the deivce as well as its own
//fields to have the name of the tape and the side and the record name and different fields for based on how the device works to play the song
//to copy a song we have a virtual method in the parent and we can override it within the child for MP3
