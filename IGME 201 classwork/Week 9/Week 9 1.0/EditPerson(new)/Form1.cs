//if we look in the designer and the combobox in window is a textbox that has a limited amount of options
//and for our person type we want that to be limited to a student and teacher and to define what the available options are we click on the items prop.
//and its a collection which is just a list and each line is an option in the combobox and the first item is student and the second is teacher
//and when we check to see which one is selected in c# we start from the 0th index

//the & is for a menu item to make it an underlined letter so we can use the keyboard instead of mouse to use the menu

//every one of these controls has a name and its (Name) because we use that name to access the fields in our code we usually put the name of how we want to access
//something in this .cs file in the "Name" property within our designer 

//the form is the class and the fields are whatever we name the things in the form (pascalcase for the form but camelcase for the fields)


//change the "Name" of the form in the Form1 form and its pascalcase because the form itself is the name of our class and the other things within that
//class in camelcase
//each form in windows form is a class and each control is a member of that class
//the form designer generates our controls and puts it as the intiializecmponent which is build in (we put all of our code below the initizlizecomponent usually)

//whenever we do windows forms development we must make it partial because the class is used between files and visual studi creates code for us in the designer.cs
//file and in the forms.cs that we edit we continue to define the class and its because the class is spread across multiple classes we have to use partial with it 
//and we need to use partial in each file because its spread across multiple files 

//the designer.cs adds the things we put within our form into the designer.cs file and the code along with it (the prop.) to set the button or textbox or whatever
//thing we set and we write event handlers explicitly for all of the objects rather than writing the method then going over to grid and filling it in with the methods
//if we double click on something and it creates a method in the form1.cs and we should just leave it 

//our form is the this keyword and the controls is used for all of the controls on the form and its built in for all of our controls
//this is in the form.designer.cs and its hidden from us and we dont modify at all because its automatically built in

//when we run a winsows application, all of the controls are interactive and triggeres events on that control that are calling delagte methods that
//lets us do what we want with the menu for exameple
//windows forms is all delegates and in the windows forms control document in the textbox category control, and it tells us the important properties
//and fields we need to work with and the validating event and the deleate method signature is also given there and in the code we wrote in the
//validating event it we hover over the validating event it tells us it's a cancel event handler type (delegate method type)(like when we wrote our own method to round)
//and here we do new canceleventhandler delegate datatype and it gives us the method signature for it and when we write our method to handle the event, our method
//needs to match the method signature that is written when we hover over the delegate method
//when we wrote out txtboxempty__validating it followed that delegate method signature and it also tells us in the documentation for windows forms controls)
//the delegate methods are defined for us already in windows forms

//we want to do specific code when the user changes a value and we use events associated with that contorl and in properties theres an evenet icon and for the combobox
//control we have 100 possible events that could be triggered and we can add methods in here to be called in here when events are triggered but
//the mapping is hid in the lightning
//panel(dont use lightning panel)(prop.panel)**


//to know what the method needs to look like its in the windows forms control documentation
//and we go to the combobox secttion and it tells us the metho signature it needs to have
//and it needs to accept and object and an eventargs and if we need to create a method we deleted by accident,
//we go to the windows forms control document and recreate
//the name of the method(we need to have all the methods assocated with each thing in the deisnger)
//we always do the thing (fields) we are doing the event on __ the event for the method signtaure
//not every contorl needs to have a delegate with it like the container control for the mdi

//if we double click a control and it makes a method in the form1.cs, then we just leave it as an empty method even if we dont do anything
//we are going to use our own names for delegate methods and we will add them within the code ourself

//the intializecomponent must be the first function call in our form1 and dont put anything above it

//every control has a tag property and when we look at the properties(wrench icon)(look at everything in alpabetical order with the a z icon)
//tag is of the object datatype and we can use it to attach any kind of data to the control (have to explicitly cast because its an object)
//and we want to know if there is valid daat that has been entered in every field and
//we do for each (control in this.controls) (the list of all of the controls in designer)

//go to toolbix then add error provuder by dragging it to the form and it does not show on the form usually but its associated with the form so we can display error messages
//on the form like we had done if one of the fields were not filled in
