//we delete the control and make a windows form by going to solution then press add then form**
//listview control is used for the class libraries we use and
//the resulting product is a list of people with teachers and students and we can add people and if we press
//enter on one of the people then we can edit the person
//the list view contorl is the same view the****

//the list view control allows us to view by list, icons, details view(we will be using),etc.
//we have a listview control with peole listview and the name i the prop. are the name of the field in the class**
//columns for the name, email, etc. (stroed in columns prop. of the list view) (if we click on dots to look at the collection
//for the columns we can see the headers for each and always look at prop. in alphabetical order)**

//for each of our column headers we have the name of the header (field??)** and the name of the actual box and the alignement
//of the columns**

//to add a new column header we do the add we are still where the 3 dots tab is in column and we
//can add a major header for the student and if we wanted to show it as the second instead of 5th then we can click arrow to move it up
//and when we click ok, it moves the header

//we always add text so we can see the label(what do the other two names do)**
//we can also press remove in the 3 dots tab as well to remove the column if we want
//we have to dith as well to display the width in the list view control
//outside of the 3 dots in the actual property, we can have gridlines or not and we can allow multi select but for now we 
//want them to select one person at a time**
//the view property allows us to change the icons and by default it gives us large icon and we need to set it to detaiils**
//to get icons to show**
