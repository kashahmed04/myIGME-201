//all courses listview has all courses from 200-299 and the top listview for the courses contains the selected courses for the students
//on the details page we have a lot more controls and now we want to do the picturebox control
//picturebox lets us show images on our form and we can customize the shape to have any shape we want and the picturebox is inside the groupbox
//and allows us to give the caption and border around the picture itself******


//when our application runs we want to be able to click the photo and what image we want to put for the student*********
//and it stores the imave that we have put in the photobox for the student****
//we first want to handle when they click the picture box (clicked event in constructor)*****
//for exam 3 we will be writing president application

//whatever contorl shows up on the bottom its not visual and opens seperately or its not associated with any specific location
//on the form*********************************
//the opendislouge allowws us to open the file exploerer functinoality*****


//the wdinwos forms contorl document has a summary of all of the controls we will be using this semester 
//we need to have courselib and peoplelib (here specifiacally or in peopleappglobals)**
//because they define the student,teacher,and course,and courses class we need for our program
//we checked to make sure if a field was empty and numeric fields were numeric for the editperson.dll
//we will refer to people list steps to create a form
//for the courses**


//I am still confused on why we have to create a reference to peoplelib because we already have our person being accessed in the peopleappglobals 
//is it because in peeoplelistview__keydown we have to point to a a new person and make it equal to the person
//we pressed enter on when we got their email from the list which returned a person object then create a new form with that person we are on so we can edit them??**
//we were just created a referrnce variable to hold an instance of the person class not a new object so thats why we need to have peoplelib defined here**

//how do we know whether to make a windows control.vs.a windows forms**

//so basically when we add a control the Name field is the name we access it with in the code and the text is what shows up on the form right**
//we have a class which is the form, the prop. which is the control but within that prop., we have fields within it to name our control and customize it**

//tag gets or sets with whatever control we use with the . notation**


//we wanted to make an interface available to the whole application and if we want accessible to the whole application we want it in a global class
//and we define it in the globals because we know its shared across everythign and we want to call pintalistview method for the people list so we chanfe people list
//to inherit that interface and so now anywhere that has acccess to the peoplelistform they can now call the paintlistview with the interface because the personeditform
//can have access to it so we can repaint the list view and move the person to the top (after we finish editing the person)**
//so basically since the personeditform inherits peopleappglobals we can use the Ilistview interface there but why do we put it here does it have something to do**
//with the this.owner** what does this.owner do**
//we can have para. in the interface (its the method signature so we have to copy it as is)**
//(how comes person editform does not inherit instead because it needs to be inherited there)**


//peoplelist when we add a new person or edit and existing a person it calls editperson and it calls it with the person that was the existing person that was
//selectoed or create the new person and everything is blank initially or??**
